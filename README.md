# bccaddress.org
JavaScript Client-Side Bitcoin Cash Wallet Generator

Generate Bitcoin Cash addresses and their corresponding private key conveniently
in a web browser.

The bccaddress.org project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/CSS/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being
loaded.

This project is based on code from bitaddress.org. Their project can be found at:
https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org. and graphical modification by https://github.com/theantnest/bccaddress

END USER NOTES:
 1) Google Chrome is recommended for the Bulk Wallet.

 2) Requires IE9+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.

 3) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.

 4) DO NOT use Opera Mini! It renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.

 5) BIP38 most likely will not work on mobile devices due to hardware limitations.
